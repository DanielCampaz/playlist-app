# Playlist App

API for automatic playlist, the API receives a login with email and password, the user can create 1 or several playlists and add videos by copying the url (copied from the panel or copied from the share button) or the iframe, the application could work from two open sessions, one on the cell phone adding the songs or videos to the list and the other at the playback location

### Requirements

For the Api (Backend) I used GO, all the dependencies are in go.sum and go.mod, for the Frontend I used nodejs with vite react typescript
